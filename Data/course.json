        "details": "physics, science that deals with the structure of matter and the interactions between the fundamental constituents of the observable universe. In the broadest sense, physics (from the Greek physikos) is concerned with all aspects of nature on both the macroscopic and submicroscopic levels. Its scope of study encompasses not only the behaviour of objects under the action of given forces but also the nature and origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force fields. Its ultimate objective is the formulation of a few comprehensive principles that bring together and explain all such disparate phenomena.Physics is the basic physical science. Until rather recent times physics and natural philosophy were used interchangeably for the science whose aim is the discovery and formulation of the fundamental laws of nature. As the modern sciences developed and became increasingly specialized, physics came to denote that part of physical science not included in astronomy, chemistry, geology, and engineering. Physics plays an important role in all the natural sciences, however, and all such fields have branches in which physical laws and measurements receive special emphasis, bearing such names as astrophysics, geophysics, biophysics, and even psychophysics. Physics can, at base, be defined as the science of matter, motion, and energy. Its laws are typically expressed with economy and precision in the language of mathematics.Both experiment, the observation of phenomena under conditions that are controlled as precisely as possible, and theory, the formulation of a unified conceptual framework, play essential and complementary roles in the advancement of physics. Physical experiments result in measurements, which are compared with the outcome predicted by theory. A theory that reliably predicts the results of experiments to which it is applicable is said to embody a law of physics. However, a law is always subject to modification, replacement, or restriction to a more limited domain, if a later experiment makes it necessary.The ultimate aim of physics is to find a unified set of laws governing matter, motion, and energy at small (microscopic) subatomic distances, at the human (macroscopic) scale of everyday life, and out to the largest distances (e.g., those on the extragalactic scale). This ambitious goal has been realized to a notable extent. Although a completely unified theory of physical phenomena has not yet been achieved (and possibly never will be), a remarkably small set of fundamental physical laws appears able to account for all known phenomena. The body of physics developed up to about the turn of the 20th century, known as classical physics, can largely account for the motions of macroscopic objects that move slowly with respect to the speed of light and for such phenomena as heat, sound, electricity, magnetism, and light. The modern developments of relativity and quantum mechanics modify these laws insofar as they apply to higher speeds, very massive objects, and to the tiny elementary constituents of matter, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons."

        "details": "chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes. Every substance, whether naturally occurring or artificially produced, consists of one or more of the hundred-odd species of atoms that have been identified as elements. Although these atoms, in turn, are composed of more elementary particles, they are the basic building blocks of chemical substances; there is no quantity of oxygen, mercury, or gold, for example, smaller than an atom of that substance. Chemistry, therefore, is concerned not with the subatomic domain but with the properties of atoms and the laws governing their combinations and how the knowledge of these properties can be used to achieve specific purposes.The great challenge in chemistry is the development of a coherent explanation of the complex behaviour of materials, why they appear as they do, what gives them their enduring properties, and how interactions among different substances can bring about the formation of new substances and the destruction of old ones. From the earliest attempts to understand the material world in rational terms, chemists have struggled to develop theories of matter that satisfactorily explain both permanence and change. The ordered assembly of indestructible atoms into small and large molecules, or extended networks of intermingled atoms, is generally accepted as the basis of permanence, while the reorganization of atoms or molecules into different arrangements lies behind theories of change. Thus chemistry involves the study of the atomic composition and structural architecture of substances, as well as the varied interactions among substances that can lead to sudden, often violent reactions.Chemistry also is concerned with the utilization of natural substances and the creation of artificial ones. Cooking, fermentation, glass making, and metallurgy are all chemical processes that date from the beginnings of civilization. Today, vinyl, Teflon, liquid crystals, semiconductors, and superconductors represent the fruits of chemical technology. The 20th century saw dramatic advances in the comprehension of the marvelous and complex chemistry of living organisms, and a molecular interpretation of health and disease holds great promise. Modern chemistry, aided by increasingly sophisticated instruments, studies materials as small as single atoms and as large and complex as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which contains millions of atoms. New substances can even be designed to bear desired characteristics and then synthesized. The rate at which chemical knowledge continues to accumulate is remarkable. Over time more than 8,000,000 different chemical substances, both natural and artificial, have been characterized and produced. The number was less than 500,000 as recently as 1965.Intimately interconnected with the intellectual challenges of chemistry are those associated with industry. In the mid-19th century the German chemist Justus von Liebig commented that the wealth of a nation could be gauged by the amount of sulfuric acid it produced. This acid, essential to many manufacturing processes, remains today the leading chemical product of industrialized countries. As Liebig recognized, a country that produces large amounts of sulfuric acid is one with a strong chemical industry and a strong economy as a whole. The production, distribution, and utilization of a wide range of chemical products is common to all highly developed nations. In fact, one can say that the “iron age” of civilization is being replaced by a “polymer age,” for in some countries the total volume of polymers now produced exceeds that of iron."

        "details": "mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th century, mathematics has been an indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences and technology, and in more recent times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.In many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits, such as commerce and agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond basic counting. This growth has been greatest in societies complex enough to sustain these activities and to provide leisure for contemplation and the opportunity to build on the achievements of earlier mathematicians.All mathematical systems (for example, Euclidean geometry) are combinations of sets of axioms and of theorems that can be logically deduced from the axioms. Inquiries into the logical and philosophical basis of mathematics reduce to questions of whether the axioms of a given system ensure its completeness and its consistency. For full treatment of this aspect, see mathematics, foundations of.This article offers a history of mathematics from ancient times to the present. As a consequence of the exponential growth of science, most mathematics has developed since the 15th century CE, and it is a historical fact that, from the 15th century to the late 20th century, new developments in mathematics were largely concentrated in Europe and North America. For these reasons, the bulk of this article is devoted to European developments since 1500.This does not mean, however, that developments elsewhere have been unimportant. Indeed, to understand the history of mathematics in Europe, it is necessary to know its history at least in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, in ancient Greece, and in Islamic civilization from the 9th to the 15th century. The way in which these civilizations influenced one another and the important direct contributions Greece and Islam made to later developments are discussed in the first parts of this article.India’s contributions to the development of contemporary mathematics were made through the considerable influence of Indian achievements on Islamic mathematics during its formative years. A separate article, South Asian mathematics, focuses on the early history of mathematics in the Indian subcontinent and the development there of the modern decimal place-value numeral system. The article East Asian mathematics covers the mostly independent development of mathematics in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam."

        "details": "Zoology DefinitionZoology, or animal biology, is the field of biology that involves the study of animals. The word zoology comes from the Greek words zōion, meaning “animal”, and logos, meaning “the study of”. It encompasses all aspects of scientific knowledge about animals, like embryonic development, evolution, behavior, ecological distribution, and classification. Zoology is broken into many branches because there are so many different ways to study animals; it is also broken into branches based on which animals are being studied.History of Zoology People have been interested in learning about animals since ancient times. The prominent ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle took detailed notes on animal observations, and inspired other scientists for many hundreds of years. Many universities were founded in Europe in the 16th Century, and by the mid-17th Century, divisions were founded in universities that focused entirely on animal research.In the 19th Century, the microscope became commonplace in scientific research, and this opened up a whole new realm of possibility; now, the cells of animals could be studied at the microscopic level. Another breakthrough in zoology occurred when the naturalist Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution by natural selection. This theory revolutionized zoology and taxonomy (classification). More recently, the discovery of DNA as life’s genetic material led to even more new research and knowledge about the natural world and the evolutionary relationships between animals.Branches of Zoology Zoography Zoography, also called descriptive zoology or zoogeography, is the study of animals and their habitats. It is concerned with the geographic ranges of specific populations of animals, their effects on the ecosystems they live in, and the reasons for a specific spatial distribution of an animal species.Comparative Anatomy Comparative anatomy is the study of similarities and differences in the anatomy of different types of animals. Closely related animals like mammals share common bones, even if these bones have been extremely modified in shape. For example, bat wings are essentially very long, thin bones that are homologous to the ones in human fingers. Studying the similar anatomical structures in related organisms provided evidence for evolution from a common ancestor that was later confirmed by genetics research. Comparative anatomy is still used today, often in paleontology, the study of fossils.Animal Physiology Animal physiology is the study of the bodily processes that occur in animals that allow them to maintain homeostasis and survive. Homeostasis is the ability of the body to maintain a relatively constant equilibrium even in a changing environment. One example is the regulation of body temperature in mammals. Humans have a normal body temperature of about 37°C (98.6°F), even when the environment they are in is much colder. Animal physiology involves the study of processes like temperature regulation, blood pressure and blood flow, and the release of hormones at specific times in the body.Ethology Ethology is the study of animal behavior, usually in regard to in their natural environment as opposed to in a lab. Ethology has roots in the work of Darwin, but emerged as a field in the 1930s. It involves the study of animal learning, cognition, communication, and sexuality, and is related to evolutionary biology and ecology. Principles from ethology research are also used in animal training.Behavioral Ecology Behavioral ecology emerged from ethology. It is the study of evolution as the basis for animal behavior due to ecological pressures, which are constraints placed upon organisms by their environment. Organisms with traits that are well-suited to their environment have a higher likelihood of surviving and reproducing than those who do not. When the proportion of individuals with favored traits increases over a long period of time, evolution can occur. Behavioral ecologists study animals’ competition for resources such as food, territory, and mates and the increased reproductive success that certain traits may give."

Formally,  is a composition if and ,  and  is a real valued constant and there are  components for each composition. In this module . Compositional data can be analyzed using Aitchison geometry. [1]However, in this framework, standard real Euclidean operations such as addition and multiplication no longer apply. Only operations such as perturbation and power can be used to manipulate this data.This module allows two styles of manipulation of compositional data. Compositional data can be analyzed using perturbation and power operations, which can be useful for simulation studies. The alternative strategy is to transform compositional data into the real space. Right now, the centre log ratio transform (clr) and the isometric log ratio transform (ilr) [2] can be used to accomplish this. This transform can be useful for performing standard statistical tools such as parametric hypothesis testing, regressions and more.The major caveat of using this framework is dealing with zeros. In the Aitchison geometry, only compositions with nonzero components can be considered. The multiplicative replacement technique [3] can be used to substitute these zeros with small pseudocounts without introducing major distortions to the data."

        "details": "Machine learning, it’s a popular buzzword that you’ve probably heard thrown around with terms artificial intelligence or AI, but what does it really mean? If you’re interested in the future of technology or wanting to pursue a degree in IT, it’s extremely important to understand what machine learning is and how it impacts every industry and individual. And earning an IT degree is easier than ever thanks to online learning, allowing you to continue to work and fulfill your responsibilities while earning a degree.Machine learning is the process of a computer program or system being able to learn and get smarter over time. At the very basic level, machine learning uses algorithms to find patterns and then applies the patterns moving forward. Machine learning is the process of a computer modeling human intelligence, and autonomously improving over time. Machines are able to make predictions about the future based on what they have observed and learned in the past. These machines don’t have to be explicitly programmed in order to learn and improve, they are able to apply what they have learned to get smarter.Machine learning vs. deep learning.Machine learning and deep learning are extremely similar, in fact deep learning is simply a subset of machine learning. However, deep learning is much more advanced that machine learning and is more capable of self-correction. Deep learning is designed to work with much larger sets of data than machine learning, and utilizes deep neural networks (DNN) to understand the data. Deep learning involves information being input into a neural network, the larger the set of data, the larger the neural network. Each layer of the neural network has a node, and each node takes part of the information and finds the patterns and data. It then passes on what it learns to the next layer, and so on. The pieces of information all come together and the output is then delivered. These nodes learn from their information piece and from each other, able to advance their learning moving forward. Machine learning is not quite so vast and sophisticated as deep learning, and is meant for much smaller sets of data.Machine learning vs. artificial intelligence.Similar to machine learning and deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence are closely related. Machine learning is an application of AI—artificial intelligence is the broad concept that machines and robots can carry out tasks in ways that are similar to humans, in ways that humans deem “smart.” It is the theory that computers can replicate human intelligence and “think.” There are many applications and uses of AI, and machine learning is one of them.Discover more about how machine learning works and see examples of how machine learning is all around us, every day."

        "details": "Introduction Neural Networks are the poster boy of Deep Learning, a section of Machine Learning characterised by its use of a large number of interwoven computations. The individual computations themselves are relatively straightforward, but it is the complexity in the connections that give them their advanced analytic ability.The Neuron The building block of a neural network is the single neuron. The diagram below shows the structure of a neutron with one input.The input to the neuron is x, which has a weight w associated with it. The weight is the intrinsic parameter, the parameter the model has control over in order to get a better fit for the output. When we pass an input into a neuron, we multiply it by its weight, giving us x * w.The second element of the input is called the bias. The bias is determined solely by the value b, since the value of the node is 1. The bias adds an element of unpredictability to our model, which helps it generalise and gives our model the flexibility to adapt to different unseen inputs when using testing data.The combination of the bias and input produces our output y, giving us a formula of w*x + b = y. This should look familiar as a modification of the equation of a straight line, y = mx + c. Neural Networks are made up of tens, hundreds or many even thousands of interconnected neurons, each of which runs its own regression. It’s essentially a regression on steroids. Multiple Inputs Naturally, we will not be able to analyse most datasets we come across in the real world using a regression as simple as the diagram above. We will expect to see many more inputs that are combined to estimate the output. This is achieved in a similar way as the neuron with one input.Through this increasing complexity, neural networks are able to transform data and infer relationships in a variety of complex ways. As we add more layers and nodes to our network, this complexity increases. Activation Function Currently our model is only good for predicting linear relationships in our data. In the previous diagram, there’s no benefit to running this neural network as opposed to a series of regressions. Neural Networks provide a solution to this in two ways. The first is the ability to add more layers to our network between the input and output, known as hidden layers. Each of these hidden layers will have a predefined number of nodes and this added complexity starts to separate the neural network from its regression counterpart. The second way that Neural Networks add complexity is through the introduction of an activation function at every node that isn’t an input or output. If you’re unfamiliar with the term, I would definitely check out a previous article I wrote on Linear Classification which looks at activation functions in far more depth, but to summarise from there, an activation function is a function that transforms our input data using a non linear method. Sigmoid and ReLu are the most commonly used activation functions."

As mentioned above, data mining techniques are used to generate descriptions and predictions about a target data set. Data scientists describe data through their observations of patterns, associations, and correlations. They also classify and cluster data through classification and regression methods, and identify outliers for use cases, like spam detection.Data mining usually consists of four main steps: setting objectives, data gathering and preparation, applying data mining algorithms, and evaluating results.1. Set the business objectives: This can be the hardest part of the data mining process, and many organizations spend too little time on this important step. Data scientists and business stakeholders need to work together to define the business problem, which helps inform the data questions and parameters for a given project. Analysts may also need to do additional research to understand the business context appropriately.2. Data preparation: Once the scope of the problem is defined, it is easier for data scientists to identify which set of data will help answer the pertinent questions to the business. Once they collect the relevant data, the data will be cleaned, removing any noise, such as duplicates, missing values, and outliers. Depending on the dataset, an additional step may be taken to reduce the number of dimensions as too many features can slow down any subsequent computation. Data scientists will look to retain the most important predictors to ensure optimal accuracy within any models.3. Model building and pattern mining: Depending on the type of analysis, data scientists may investigate any interesting data relationships, such as sequential patterns, association rules, or correlations. While high frequency patterns have broader applications, sometimes the deviations in the data can be more interesting, highlighting areas of potential fraud.Deep learning algorithms may also be applied to classify or cluster a data set depending on the available data. If the input data is labelled (i.e. supervised learning), a classification model may be used to categorize data, or alternatively, a regression may be applied to predict the likelihood of a particular assignment. If the dataset isn’t labelled (i.e. unsupervised learning), the individual data points in the training set are compared with one another to discover underlying similarities, clustering them based on those characteristics.4. Evaluation of results and implementation of knowledge: Once the data is aggregated, the results need to be evaluated and interpreted. When finalizing results, they should be valid, novel, useful, and understandable. When this criteria is met, organizations can use this knowledge to implement new strategies, achieving their intended objectives."

        "details": "If deep learning is a subset of machine learning, how do they differ? Deep learning distinguishes itself from classical machine learning by the type of data that it works with and the methods in which it learns.Machine learning algorithms leverage structured, labeled data to make predictions—meaning that specific features are defined from the input data for the model and organized into tables. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it doesn’t use unstructured data; it just means that if it does, it generally goes through some pre-processing to organize it into a structured format.Deep learning eliminates some of data pre-processing that is typically involved with machine learning. These algorithms can ingest and process unstructured data, like text and images, and it automates feature extraction, removing some of the dependency on human experts. For example, let’s say that we had a set of photos of different pets, and we wanted to categorize by “cat”, “dog”, “hamster”, et cetera. Deep learning algorithms can determine which features (e.g. ears) are most important to distinguish each animal from another. In machine learning, this hierarchy of features is established manually by a human expert.Then, through the processes of gradient descent and backpropagation, the deep learning algorithm adjusts and fits itself for accuracy, allowing it to make predictions about a new photo of an animal with increased precision.Machine learning and deep learning models are capable of different types of learning as well, which are usually categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning utilizes labeled datasets to categorize or make predictions; this requires some kind of human intervention to label input data correctly. In contrast, unsupervised learning doesn’t require labeled datasets, and instead, it detects patterns in the data, clustering them by any distinguishing characteristics. Reinforcement learning is a process in which a model learns to become more accurate for performing an action in an environment based on feedback in order to maximize the reward.For a deeper dive on the nuanced differences between the different technologies, see For a closer look at the specific differences between supervised and unsupervised learning."

        "details": "Database defined A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are beginning to appear.Evolution of the database Databases have evolved dramatically since their inception in the early 1960s. Navigational databases such as the hierarchical database (which relied on a tree-like model and allowed only a one-to-many relationship), and the network database (a more flexible model that allowed multiple relationships), were the original systems used to store and manipulate data. Although simple, these early systems were inflexible. In the 1980s, relational databases became popular, followed by object-oriented databases in the 1990s. More recently, NoSQL databases came about as a response to the growth of the internet and the need for faster speed and processing of unstructured data. Today, cloud databases and self-driving databases are breaking new ground when it comes to how data is collected, stored, managed, and utilized.This article is about the computing concept. For instances of the general concept, see Lists of databases.An SQL select statement and its resultIn computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient datarepresentation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term 'database' is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they support. Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages."

React was released by Facebook in 2013, and they still use it today for many of their applications. If you're new to React, this article will help introduce you to the basics. Or, if you'd rather learn by doing, you can jump right in with our Learn React course. What is React used for React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Here are three places you'll find it being used Web development This is where React got its start and where you'll find it used most often. React is component-based. An example of a component could be a form or even just a form field or button on a website. In React, you build up complete applications using components like these by nesting them.Components in React can manage their own state and communicate that state to child components. By we mean the data that populates the web application.An example would be a user profile form that holds the state of the user's data, including first name, last name, and other values. This form component would have nested field components that it passes its state to in order to populate them.Components in React are also reusable, which means you can use one button component for every button on your site. If you need the button to look different, you can simply change its style.Mobile app development React Native is a JavaScript framework that uses React. With React Native, developers can apply web-based React principles to creating mobile apps for Android and iOS. Here, React is used to connect the mobile user interface of the application to the phone's operating system.Desktop app development Developers can also use React with Electron, another JavaScript library, to create cross-platform desktop apps. Some apps you may know about that are built with Electron include Visual Studio Code, Slack, Skype, Discord, WhatsApp, and WordPress Desktop.React example Let's look at a React example so you have a better idea of how it works. A React web application runs on one web page. Here's an example of an HTML file used to run a React app Using script tags, we import the JavaScript libraries necessary for React to run. React and React DOM are the basic React libraries we need. Babel is a JavaScript library that compiles the JSX language that React uses into JavaScript the browser can understand.The div element that has the root id is where the whole React app will run. And the script tag below that is where all the React code will go, which we'll look at in more detail next.To use React, you need to create components that use JSX. Below is an example componentfunction Heading(props)The component above is a simple JavaScript function that accepts a parameter called props — a special keyword in React used to pass data between components.The function returns the value attribute of props wrapped with what looks like an HTML  tag. This isn't actual HTML, yet. It's called JSX, a React-specific syntax that allows HTML-like text to co-exist with JavaScript.Below, we have another component that uses our Heading component. In fact, it uses it three times to create headings with different values. Note that the props in React are passed to child components as attributes of the JSX.function You'll also notice that the name of this component is App. This is because it's our complete application. Everything in React is a component, including the whole application. To render this app to the browser, we need one more piece of code.ReactDOM.render This code tells React to render the results in the HTML element that has the root id.React is the most popular JavaScript front-end framework in use today.

This form component would have nested field components that it passes its state to in order to populate them.Components in React are also reusable, which means you can use one button component for every button on your site. If you need the button to look different, you can simply change its style.Mobile app development React Native is a JavaScript framework that uses React. With React Native, developers can apply web-based React principles to creating mobile apps for Android and iOS. Here, React is used to connect the mobile user interface of the application to the phone's operating system.Desktop app development Developers can also use React with Electron, another JavaScript library, to create cross-platform desktop apps. Some apps you may know about that are built with Electron include Visual Studio Code, Slack, Skype, Discord, WhatsApp, and WordPress Desktop.React example Let's look at a React example so you have a better idea of how it works. A React web application runs on one web page. Here's an example of an HTML file used to run a React app Using script tags, we import the JavaScript libraries necessary for React to run. React and React DOM are the basic React libraries we need. Babel is a JavaScript library that compiles the JSX language that React uses into JavaScript the browser can understand.The div element that has the root id is where the whole React app will run. And the script tag below that is where all the React code will go, which we'll look at in more detail next.To use React, you need to create components that use JSX. Below is an example componentfunction Heading(props)The component above is a simple JavaScript function that accepts a parameter called props — a special keyword in React used to pass data between components.The function returns the value attribute of props wrapped with what looks like an HTML  tag. This isn't actual HTML, yet. It's called JSX, a React-specific syntax that allows HTML-like text to co-exist with JavaScript.Below, we have another component that uses our Heading component. In fact, it uses it three times to create headings with different values. Note that the props in React are passed to child components as attributes of the JSX.function You'll also notice that the name of this component is App. This is because it's our complete application. Everything in React is a component, including the whole application. To render this app to the browser, we need one more piece of code.ReactDOM.render This code tells React to render the results in the HTML element that has the root id."

        "details": "PowerPoint was developed by Dennis Austin and Thomas Rudkin at Forethought Inc. It was supposed to be named Presenter, but the name was not adapted due to trademark issues. It was renamed PowerPoint in 1987 as suggested by Robert Gaskins.In August of 1987, Microsoft bought Forethought for $14 million and turned it into its graphics business unit, where the company continued to develop the software. The first iteration was launched together with Windows 3.0 in 1990. It only allowed slide progression in one direction – forward – and the amount of customization was fairly limited.Although it was conceived only for Macintosh computers in the very beginning, PowerPoint quickly became one of the most iconic trademarks and the first important acquisition of Microsoft. Even today, it holds up to 95 percent of the market share of presentation software.PowerPoint allows users to create media-rich presentations constituted by a series of slides. Since it’s fully integrated with the other tools of the Microsoft Office suite, the user can import content created with Excel or Word into PowerPoint, as well as other media such as pictures, audio, and video clips.To create slides, a series of templates are used to provide the user with pre-defined layouts for different purposes. Once the theme that will be used in the presentation is set by defining a standard font, background color, and layout, that slide is saved as “master slide.” The user can either change each other slide accordingly, or edit the master slide to propagate the change to all the other slides uniformly.During a PowerPoint presentation, the presenter has the liberty to define the pace by controlling the flow manually or having the slide swap at preset intervals, which may also be different for each slide. Individual elements on a slide may also appear after a certain command is issued, such as bullet points or videos.PowerPoint experienced a very significant change in PowerPoint 97, which added predefined transition effects and allowed the user to time them appropriately so that slides would transition automatically. This allowed a presenter to follow a predefined progression and go on with the presentation without pausing to change or read the slides. PowerPoint 2007 introduced the 'ribbon' interface, marking a drastic change from the previous interface style.In older versions of PowerPoint, presentations were saved only as a standard .pptx format. However, newer versions from 2013 and 2016 allow the users to save presentations in different common formats such as pictures (JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.), videos (WMV or MPEG-4), or text (PDF).PowerPoint was developed by Dennis Austin and Thomas Rudkin at Forethought Inc.

Visual objects used in forms and reports expose their methods and properties in the VBA programming environment, and VBA code modules may declare and call Windows operating system operations.Microsoft Access is a database management system (DBMS) from Microsoft that combines the relational Access Database Engine (ACE) with a graphical user interface and software-development tools (not to be confused with the old Microsoft Access which was a telecommunication program that provided terminal emulation and interfaces for ease of use in accessing online services such as Dow Jones, Compuserve and electronic mailbox back during 1980s[3][4]). It is a member of the Microsoft 365 suite of applications, included in the Professional and higher editions or sold separately.Microsoft Access stores data in its own format based on the Access Database Engine (formerly Jet Database Engine). It can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases.[5]Software developers, data architects and power users can use Microsoft Access to develop application software.

A cross-compiler produces code for a different CPU or operating system than the one on which the cross-compiler itself runs. A bootstrap compiler is often a temporary compiler, used for compiling a more permanent or better optimised compiler for a language.Related software include, a program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler ; a program that translates between high-level languages, usually called a source-to-source compiler or transpiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. A compiler-compiler is a compiler that produces a compiler (or part of one), often in a generic and reusable way so as to be able to produce many differing compilers.A compiler is likely to perform some or all of the following operations, often called phases: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation. Compilers generally implement these phases as modular components, promoting efficient design and correctness of transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.[4]Compilers are not the only language processor used to transform source programs.

A compiler-compiler is a compiler that produces a compiler (or part of one), often in a generic and reusable way so as to be able to produce many differing compilers.A compiler is likely to perform some or all of the following operations, often called phases: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation. Compilers generally implement these phases as modular components, promoting efficient design and correctness of transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.[4]Compilers are not the only language processor used to transform source programs. An interpreter is computer software that transforms and then executes the indicated operations.[2]: p2  The translation process influences the design of computer languages, which leads to a preference of compilation or interpretation. In theory, a programming language can have both a compiler and an interpreter. In practice, programming languages tend to be associated with just one (a compiler or an interpreter)."

The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit. The integrated circuit is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations.[1] The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.The integration of a whole CPU onto a single or a few integrated circuits using Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) greatly reduced the cost of processing power. Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) fabrication processes, resulting in a relatively low unit price. Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are much fewer electrical connections that could fail. As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same according to Rock's law.Before microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many medium- and small-scale integrated circuits, typically of TTL type. Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. While there is disagreement over who deserves credit for the invention of the microprocessor, the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed by Federico Faggin and introduced in 1971.[2]Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see history of computing hardware), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers.A microprocessor is a computer processor where the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit, or a small number of integrated circuits.

Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. While there is disagreement over who deserves credit for the invention of the microprocessor, the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed by Federico Faggin and introduced in 1971.[2]Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see history of computing hardware), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers."

        "details": "Automation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, namely by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines.[1] Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes, and ships typically use combinations of all of these techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, reducing waste, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.Automation includes the use of various equipment and control systems such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers,[2] and heat-treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering, and stabilization of ships, aircraft, and other applications and vehicles with reduced human intervention.[3] Examples range from a household thermostat controlling a boiler to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. Automation has also found space in the banking sector. In control complexity, it can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms.In the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department.[4] It was during this time that industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.[5]The World Bank's World Development Report of 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation.[6] Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation have been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s.Automation describes a wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in processes, namely by predetermining decision criteria, subprocess relationships, and related actions, as well as embodying those predeterminations in machines.[1] Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices, and computers, usually in combination.
